# Drum Kit
This website lets you play a simple drumset (four toms, a kick bass, a crash cymbal, and a snare). You may either click on each component or press the cooresponding keyboard key to play that component's sound.

## Working Example
You can find a working example on my personal website gtaylor314.github.io
